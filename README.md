## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Alysa! I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying Computer Science. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I love learning in any way that I can. While I am majoring in Computer Science I also love to
  learn about things that I can apply to my every day life.

My goal is to be able to use technology to make everyday life easier and more exciting to live and make the world a better place.

## Languages
- Proficient in: C#, Python, Java, JavaScript
- Dabbled in: HTML/CSS, Kotlin, Clojure, Erlang

## Projects and Work
Below are a couple of my favorite projects
- [Guessing Number Mobile App](https://github.com/AlysaJarrell/GuessingGameApp)
    This is a simple app that was written in Kotlin through Android Studio.

- [ClientServerNetworking](https://github.com/AlysaJarrell/ClientServerNetworking)
    This is a basic TCP client-server network written in Python, I wrote this to further my understanding about networks and sockets.

- [Me, Mineself, and I](https://github.com/dohmandjo/pythonGamers)

- [Craner Cravings- Website](https://alysajarrell.github.io/wdd130/cranercravings/index.html)

  [Github](https://github.com/AlysaJarrell/wdd130/tree/master/cranercravings)

  Craner Cravings is a website I created to store all my favorite recipes so that I can have access to them even when I am away from home. (Craner is my maiden name, and the website is filled with my own favorite recipes). I want to add more recipes to the website and make it more mobile-friendly.

As proof of concept, and to practice basic language concepts I have written the game Tic-Tac-Toe in various languages.
